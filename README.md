A more modern man page viewer for our terminals

This program is still under early development. Nothing works yet.

Update (2023-11-02): Most of the intended functionality is now complete. The program can now browse through manual pages and apropos/whatis results. Most other functionality, including link handling, free text search, and navigation history, has also been implemented. The program's manual page and online help are still missing though, as is the ability to customize the program using a config file. Hopefully I'll have all that ready in time for Christmas. Ho-ho-ho, and all that.
