A more modern man page viewer for our terminals

This program is still under early development. Nothing works yet.

Update (2023-11-02): Displaying manual, apropos, and whatis pages, navigating using keyboard and mouse, and opening links to other manual pages now work. So, the program is starting to actually resemble something useful. A lot of basic functionality is still missing, though (most importantly, history navigation and search).
